# 3D Mouse
### _Discription_

The Project shows how we can interact with our PCs more interactivly with the use of 3-dimentional Gesture Capture. As Hardware we have used MPU 9250, contolled by ESP D1 mini. 

### _Working_

##### 1. Hardware :
The ESP reads the motion of hand from the MPU. Then the algorithm determines the type of motion based on the changing values of X, Y and Z axises.
##### 2. Software :
The ESP reads the motion of hand from the MPU. Then the algorithm determines the type of motion based on the changing values of X, Y and Z axises
